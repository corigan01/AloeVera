/// # Heapless Vector Error
/// This is the errors that heapless vector can encounter while using it.
///
/// Some Errors include:
///     * VectorFull
///     * OutOfBounds
///
/// ### What these errors mean?
///
/// `VectorFull` is probably the most common error that you might encounter as it is called
/// when you try to push an element into a full vector. Since this vector is not heap allocated
/// and instead lives on the stack, it must have a known size know at compile time. This is
/// unfortunate as it limits the user to the size defined at compile time.
///
/// `OutOfBounds` is going to be another big one that users might encounter while using
/// this structure as it is returned when you try to access something in the vector that is
/// out of bounds of the valid data.
///

/// # Heapless Vector
/// Heapless vector is my method on abstracting the use of raw type arrays that can be hard to
/// deal with and add elements to. So this is a heapless abstraction of that. Unfortunately since
/// there is no heap allocator, we must live on the stack which has its limitations. These
/// limitations include having a size known at compile time which can be inconvenient due to the
/// limitation of max size. However, its also bad for the other reason as if this vector is oversize
/// for the data, it still takes up all that data in 'preparation' for the addition of new data.
///
///
/// # Common Usage
/// ```rust
/// use over_stacked::heapless_vector::HeaplessVec;
///
/// fn main() {
///     let mut my_vector: HeaplessVec<usize, 10> = HeaplessVec::new();
///
///     my_vector.push_within_capacity(2).unwrap();
///     my_vector.push_within_capacity(6).unwrap();
///
///     assert_eq!(my_vector.get(0).unwrap(), &2_usize);
///     assert_eq!(my_vector.get(1).unwrap(), &6_usize);
///     assert_eq!(my_vector.len(), 2_usize);
