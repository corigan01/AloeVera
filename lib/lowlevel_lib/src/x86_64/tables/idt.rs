/// This is the most basic form of the IDT. Each entry is made up of a few parts that the cpu needs

///  gdt_selector: Segment
///  options: EntryOptions
///  pointer_middle: u16
///  pointer_high: u32
///  reserved: u32

/// pointer, but only the first 16 bits of it. Since X86 is a weird architecture, it has odd
/// backwards compatibility, because of this we have the pointer split-up.
///
/// The `gdt_selector` is simple little structure that gives a GDT reference to every entry. This
/// mostly does not matter in 64-bit mode, but in older versions it was how privileges where controlled.
///
/// The `options` is how the cpu knows who, and when can an interrupt be called. For example, a
/// userspace application is not allowed to call `Double Fault` directly because then any program
/// can just cause the CPU to panic and the operating system would not be able to shut the program
/// down. For this reason userspace applications are only allowed to call the interrupts that the
/// kernel agrees is necessary. These are usually system calls that are allowed to be called. This
/// is because the operating system has full control on what the interrupts do and dont do.
///
/// The next two fields in our Entry struct is the second half of the pointer as mentioned before.
/// This is just the higher 48-bits of the pointer and the rest are discarded and must be 0.
///
/// `reserved` is probably the most odd thing in here. These bits **MUST** be zero. Sometimes
/// emulators will store information in them, and on real hardware it can cause a Protection Fault
/// if any of these bits are set. In special cases, these bits can also make the system super
/// unpredictable. Weird memory or untraceable errors can happen if these bits are set. For that
/// reason, when you submit the IDT it checks if these bits are zero in every entry and will Err if
/// there is even a single bit set.
